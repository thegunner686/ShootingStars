## Game Mechanics

### Movement

##### WASD and Arrow keys to control left and right players, respectively.

##### You can hold down or smash movement keys to accelerate

##### Bounce off of the walls, and slight gravity down

### Winning

##### Collect blue meteors to gain mass

##### You gain a passive amount of mass based on if you "control" a majority of the screen
##### "control" is to be closest to the most amount boundary nodes, so corner your opponent

##### Use your mass to slingshot the opponent into the fiery center (the closer you get to your opponent, the more you affect them)
